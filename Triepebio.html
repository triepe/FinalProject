	<p><b>I am a single mom who has decided to go back to school. 
	Along with my 2 girls, I have a cat named Kristoff who likes to lay on my books when I study. 
	In my free time I enjoy reading books, watching TV/Movies, and playing video games, 
	all of the Sci-Fi/Fantasy nature. I also lead the local skeptics group that helps 
	promote science and logic based reasoning in the community.</b>

		<blockquote><i> I barely graduated high school back in 2001. I found school boring, 
		and due to other things going on in my life, never took it seriously.
		I was already part of the National Guard, so I never went to college, but instead got my MOS(Military Occupational
		Specialty) as an all wheel vehical mechanic. After that I never thought to pursue a higher education. But now 
		divorced, with 2 young girls, being able to be a positive female role model is the most important thing to me.</i>
